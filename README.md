# SapceX-Data-Analysis-and-Insights

1. SpaceX Data API - In this notebook I have used SpaceX API to get the data, you can get API link in notebook.
2. SpaceX WebScraping - I have used Beautifulsoup to get the data from Wikipedia which was unstructured link for wikipedia can be found in the notebook.
3. DataWrangling - Cleaning the data is required as the data was unstructured, so used pandas to clean the data by removing null values and providing mean values whereever required.
4. EDA SQL - I have got multiple insights from exploratory data analysis using SQL, I have what are the launching sites, maximum payload, and more again please feel free to look into notebook.
5. Data Visualisation - Used Seaborn library to look into the data which was explored in SQL.
6. Visualizing locations - This notebook comprises of success and failures where it happened and nearest locations to launch sites like cities, roads and coasts.
7. You can check the dahboards using spacex_dash_app.py
8. Structured data is provided as csv file.
